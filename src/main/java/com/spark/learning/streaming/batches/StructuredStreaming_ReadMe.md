Got it! Let’s break down why **the 1st approach failed** and **the 2nd worked**, step by step.

---

## **1️⃣ First Approach**

```java
windowedAgg.writeStream()
    .foreachBatch((batchDF, batchId) -> {
        batchDF.createOrReplaceTempView("batch_view");
        Dataset<Row> q = spark.sql(
            "SELECT category, SUM(cnt) as sum_cnt, SUM(total_amt) as sum_amt " +
            "FROM batch_view GROUP BY category ORDER BY sum_amt DESC"
        );
        q.show(false);
    })
```

### **Why it failed**

1. **Temp view scoping in Structured Streaming**

    * `foreachBatch` runs **inside a micro-batch thread**.
    * `createOrReplaceTempView("batch_view")` **registers the view on the Spark session**.
    * If the DataFrame schema contains **structs or top-level columns not expected**, Spark SQL may **fail to resolve column names**.

2. **Struct column issues**

    * If your DataFrame has a `window` column as a struct (common after `groupBy(window(...))`), you cannot directly do:

      ```sql
      SELECT category, SUM(cnt), SUM(total_amt) FROM batch_view
      ```
    * Spark SQL **cannot find columns** inside the struct unless you flatten it (`window.start AS start`).

3. **Streaming micro-batch nuances**

    * Even if temp view exists, **SQL resolution happens before execution**.
    * If the view has `start` and `end` columns at top-level instead of `window` struct, the query `window.start` fails → temp view SQL breaks.

✅ So the first approach **depends heavily on the exact schema** of the micro-batch DataFrame, and minor differences (flattened vs struct columns) break it.

## **2️⃣ Second Approach**

```java
windowedAgg.writeStream()
    .foreachBatch((batchDF, batchId) -> {
        Dataset<Row> batchFlat = batchDF
            .withColumnRenamed("start", "window_start")
            .withColumnRenamed("end", "window_end");
        Dataset<Row> q = batchFlat.groupBy("category")
            .agg(sum("cnt").alias("sum_cnt"), sum("total_amt").alias("sum_amt"))
            .orderBy(col("sum_amt").desc());
        q.show(false);
    })
```

### **Why it worked**

1. **No temp view used**

    * Aggregation is done **directly on the DataFrame** (`batchFlat`).
    * Removes dependency on SQL catalog resolution → avoids `TABLE_OR_VIEW_NOT_FOUND` errors.

2. **Renaming columns**

    * `start` and `end` columns are renamed to avoid conflicts / reserved keyword issues.
    * Flattening ensures all columns are **top-level**, so aggregation works smoothly.

3. **Safe in Structured Streaming**

    * `foreachBatch` is designed to operate **directly on the micro-batch DataFrame**.
    * Using DataFrame API (`groupBy`, `agg`, `orderBy`) is more robust than temp view + SQL inside streaming.

## **✅ Key Differences**

| Aspect                   | 1st Approach                                              | 2nd Approach                                                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Aggregation method       | SQL query on temp view (`spark.sql(...)`)                 | DataFrame API (`groupBy().agg()`)                           |
| Temp view                | Needed (`createOrReplaceTempView`)                        | Not needed                                                  |
| Column flattening        | Assumes `window` struct exists / correct columns          | Columns are renamed / flattened to match expected schema    |
| Robustness               | Sensitive to schema changes / struct vs top-level columns | Works regardless of whether `window` is struct or top-level |
| Recommended in streaming | ❌ prone to errors                                         | ✅ robust and safer                                          |

---

### **Bottom line**

* **Structured Streaming + `foreachBatch` → prefer DataFrame API over temp views**.
* Only use temp views / SQL if you are **sure about the schema of the micro-batch DataFrame**.
* Flatten struct columns or rename reserved keywords before using them in SQL.
